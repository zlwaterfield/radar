# AI-Powered Keyword Notifications

## Overview

Radar includes an advanced AI-powered keyword notification system that allows you to receive notifications when GitHub content matches keywords or topics you care about, even when there's not an exact match.

## How It Works

Unlike traditional keyword matching systems that only detect exact matches, Radar's AI-powered system understands the semantic meaning behind content. This means it can detect discussions related to your keywords even when the exact terms aren't used.

For example, if you set "performance" as a keyword, Radar might notify you about:
- A pull request titled "Optimizing database query speed"
- A comment mentioning "the app is running slowly on production"
- A review suggesting "we should reduce the bundle size"

## Setting Up Keyword Notifications

1. Navigate to the **Settings** page
2. Scroll to the **Keyword Notifications** section
3. Toggle the feature **On**
4. Add keywords that are relevant to your work
5. Adjust the confidence threshold slider (higher = stricter matching, lower = more flexible matching)
6. Click **Save Changes**

## Confidence Threshold

The confidence threshold controls how strictly Radar matches your keywords:

- **High threshold (0.8-1.0)**: Only very close semantic matches will trigger notifications
- **Medium threshold (0.5-0.7)**: A good balance between relevance and coverage
- **Low threshold (0.3-0.4)**: More flexible matching, but may include less relevant content

We recommend starting with the default threshold (0.7) and adjusting based on your experience.

## Example Keywords

Here are some examples of effective keywords to use:

- **Technical areas**: "security", "performance", "accessibility"
- **Team or project names**: "authentication-team", "checkout-service"
- **Components you maintain**: "payment-api", "user-dashboard"
- **Specific concerns**: "memory-leak", "race-condition"

## How Notifications Appear

When Radar detects content matching your keywords, you'll receive a notification that includes:

- The matched keyword
- The confidence score of the match
- The title of the pull request or comment
- A link to view the full content

These notifications appear alongside your regular role-based notifications in the Recent Activity section of your dashboard and in any connected notification channels (like Slack).

## Technical Implementation

Behind the scenes, Radar uses the Universal Sentence Encoder model to convert both your keywords and GitHub content into semantic vectors. It then calculates the cosine similarity between these vectors to determine how closely they match.

This approach allows Radar to understand the meaning behind content rather than just looking for exact string matches, making the system much more powerful for tracking topics you care about.

## Tips for Effective Keyword Notifications

- **Be specific**: Instead of broad terms like "bug", use more specific terms like "memory-leak" or "race-condition"
- **Use phrases**: You can use multi-word phrases like "database performance" for more specific matching
- **Adjust as needed**: If you're getting too many or too few notifications, adjust your keywords and threshold
- **Combine with role-based notifications**: Keyword notifications work alongside Radar's role-based notification system

## Limitations

- The system works best with English content
- Very short keywords (1-2 characters) may not provide meaningful semantic matching
- Extremely technical or domain-specific terminology might not have strong semantic representations

## Privacy and Data Usage

Radar's keyword matching happens server-side, but your keywords are only used to match against GitHub content you would already have access to. Your keywords are stored securely in your user settings and are never shared with other users.
