## ðŸŽ¯ Roadmap

- Now
   - Information architecture for notifications / keywords. Right now they go to the DM with the app messages. We should pull notification settings and keys together and let the user configure multiple variations of notifications where they can have multiple configurations of keywords and notifications settings and choose where they go. Like digests, they should be able to choose the scope of if it's for their user or a team they belong to.
   - Test all notification types.
   - Confirm message copy for each notification type.
   - Test digests and stats they are pulling.
- Next
   - Billing and subscription management
   - Github Discussions support
   - Better Slack homepage
   - Slack / Github user connecting to @ in notifications
- Later
   - User and team statistics
   - More sources than just Github
